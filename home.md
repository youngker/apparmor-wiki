[AppArmor](About)
=====================================

Welcome to the AppArmor security project wiki, the wiki for users
and developers of the AppArmor security project.

Description
-----------

AppArmor is an effective and easy-to-use Linux application security
system. AppArmor proactively protects the operating system and
applications from external or internal threats, even zero-day attacks,
by enforcing good behavior and preventing even unknown application
flaws from being exploited. AppArmor security policies completely
define what system resources individual applications can access,
and with what privileges. A number of default policies are included
with AppArmor, and using a combination of advanced static analysis
and learning-based tools, AppArmor policies for even very complex
applications can be deployed successfully in a matter of hours.
