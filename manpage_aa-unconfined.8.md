# NAME

aa-unconfined - output a list of processes with tcp or udp ports that do
not have AppArmor profiles loaded

# SYNOPSIS

**aa-unconfined \[_--paranoid_\] \[_--with-ss_ | _--with-netstat_\]**

# OPTIONS

- **--paranoid**

    Displays all processes from `/proc` filesystem with tcp or udp ports
    that do not have AppArmor profiles loaded.

- **--with-ss**

    Use the ss(8) command to find processes listening on network sockets
    (the default).

- **--with-netstat**

    Use the netstat(8) command to find processes listening on network
    sockets. This is also what aa-unconfined will fall back to when ss(8)
    is not available.

# DESCRIPTION

**aa-unconfined** will use netstat(8) to determine which processes have open
network sockets and do not have AppArmor profiles loaded into the kernel.

# BUGS

**aa-unconfined** must be run as root to retrieve the process executable
link from the `/proc` filesystem. This program is susceptible to race
conditions of several flavours: an unlinked executable will be mishandled;
an executable started before an AppArmor profile is loaded will not
appear in the output, despite running without confinement; a process that dies
between the netstat(8) and further checks will be mishandled. This
program only lists processes using TCP and UDP. In short, this
program is unsuitable for forensics use and is provided only as an aid
to profiling all network-accessible processes in the lab.
