# NAME

aa-autodep - guess basic AppArmor profile requirements

# SYNOPSIS

**aa-autodep _&lt;executable>_ \[_&lt;executable>_ ...\] \[_-d /path/to/profiles_\] \[_-f_\]**

# OPTIONS

**-d --dir  /path/to/profiles**

    Specifies where to look for the AppArmor security profile set.
    Defaults to /etc/apparmor.d.

**-f --force**

    Overwrites any existing AppArmor profile for the executable with the generated minimal AppArmor profile.

# DESCRIPTION

**aa-autodep** is used to generate a minimal AppArmor profile for a set of
executables. This program will generate a profile for binary executable
as well as interpreted script programs. At a minimum aa-autodep will provide
a base profile containing a base include directive which includes basic
profile entries needed by most programs.  The profile is generated by
recursively calling ldd(1) on the executables listed on the command line.

The _--force_ option will overwrite any existing profile for the executable with
the newly generated minimal AppArmor profile.

# BUGS

This program does not perform full static analysis of executables, so
the profiles generated are necessarily incomplete. If you find any bugs,
please report them at
[https://gitlab.com/apparmor/apparmor/-/issues](https://gitlab.com/apparmor/apparmor/-/issues).
