# Introduction

AppArmor is a long lived project and the set of features that are supported have evolved over time, and continues to evolve. Not only does the supported feature set change but there are independent parts: kernel, userspace tools, policy and trusted helpers each co-evolving but with independent changes. Not only do the components evolve partially independently but components from different versions may be used together so its important to understand their interactions.

## Kernel
- The kernel presents a set of features that it can enforce to userspace. This is known as the kernel feature set or abi.
- The kernel can not enforce features that are not compiled into it, but its policy support is flexible and it can do partial policy enforcement. As long as the loaded policy passes the kernels policy consistency checks it can be loaded and enforced to the best of the kernels ability.
- policy using the policydb format can specify rule types the kernel may not be able to enforce.
- the kernel can support older policy that does not support all the features that the kernel supports. In this case the kernel will not enforce features that the policy was not authored for.

## Userspace tools

### Policy compiler (aka apparmor_parser)
The policy compiler is the only part of the userspace tool chain required enable apparmor it converts text policy into the binary policy format and can load the binary policy into the kernel for enforcement.
- compiles and builds policy that is loaded into the kernel
- glue between policy and kernel/trusted helpers

### Init scripts/systemd

### Libapparmor

## Policy
- limits applications
- often dependent on application versions, OS release versions
- dependent on supported features of userspace and kernel

## Trusted helpers
- similar to kernel for policy, but rely on kernel and userspace support for to help with their policy enforcement.

#AppArmor 2.x
- feature pinning
- use kernel features

#AppArmor 3.x
- policy features
- feature pinning
- lesser of kernel features or base 3.0 feature set
